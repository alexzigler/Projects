[Software development]

C# game Ultimate TicTacToe

 - the inspiration for this project was back in high school when we used to play this game during classes;
 - the logic is not extremely complex, but not easy either;
 - the main task was locking and unlocking certain squares and deciding whether one local board was won by a player;

Java multithreading app

 - complex logic;
 - a variety of model classes interacting with each other;
 - working with input/output streams;
 - design patterns such as Thread-safe Singleton;
 - Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path;


Java employee time tracking app

 - working with client/server concepts;
 - data tranmission between different IDEs;
 - Java Spring framework;
 - great use of data manipulation and SQL;

System identification - Finding an unknown function

 - nonlinear function with 2 inputs and one output given by a noisy data set;
 - construction of regressors and finding the parameters using linear regression;
 - determine and validate the polynomial approximator with variable degree;

System identification - Nonlinear ARX (collaboration with 2 more university mates)

 - noisy data set for SISO dynamic system;
 - construction of regressors and finding the parameters using linear regression 
 - prediction and simulation;
