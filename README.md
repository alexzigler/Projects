# Projects

AutoCAD Project

 - pick a mechanical part
 - measure all the dimensions
 - draw it in AutoCAD top view and side view

C# game Ultimate TicTacToe

 - the inspiration for this project was back in high school when we used to play this game during classes
 - the logic is not extremely complex, but not easy either
 - main task was locking and unlocking certain squares and deciding wether one local board was won by a player
 - very fun project to do

Java multithreading app

 - complex logic
 - a lot of model classes interacting with each other
 - working with input/output streams
 - design patterns such as Thread-safe Singleton
 - Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path


Java employee time tracking app

 - working with client/server concepts
 - data tranmission between different IDEs
 - Java Spring framework
 - great use of data manipulation and SQL

Twin Rotor control

 - highly nonlinear system that mimics a helicopter in the laboratory
 - could not properly identify its model
 - identification methods were open loop, closed loop and mathematical full modeling, but all of them failed
 - the control method used was decoupling the multiple-input-multiple-output system into 2 single-input-single-output systems
 - designed 2 PID controllers for the 2 systems and the decoupling tehnique
 - the simulations worked fine with the identified model, but the real system was unstable, so obviously the determined model waas wrong
 - overall difficult task to gather data, merge it and use it to control the system

Estimators in dynamic systems

 - understanding a wide variety of observers and control concepts
 - simulating and testing the results of the developed control loops
 - pretty complex tasks, but all were successful

Power electronics

 - designing a stabilized voltage source
 - modeling every single part of it, in order to properly understand what is going on
 - plenty of computations for the electrical components
 - control loops for the designed proccess

Water tanks control

 - complete modeling of a complex proccess, using approximations
 - different control tehniques such as classic PID control, cascade and feedforward for countering the effect of multiple types of perturbation
 - identifying linear models near variable operating point 
 - enjoyed automating this project as much as possible

System Theory Project

 - determine the model of a process using differential equations
 - state space, transfer function and canonical forms 
 - analysis of stability, performances and root locus method 

System identification - Finding an unknown function (collaboration with 2 more university mates)

 - nonlinear function with 2 inputs and one output given by a noisy data set
 - construction of regressors and finding the parameters using linear regression
 - determine and validate the polynomial approximator with variable degree 

System identification - Nonlinear ARX (collaboration with 2 more university mates)

 - noisy data set for SISO dynamic system
 - construction of regressors and finding the parameters using linear regression 
 - prediction and simulation 
 - determine and validate the polynomial nonlinear ARX model


OpenGL project 

 - the task was to draw something dynamic in OpenGL
 - I chose a Rubik's cube since i enjoy soving them in real life
 - the cube can be rotated and translated in the window

Python project

 -this project is unfinished; its main purpose is testing OOP concepts in python and modeling mathematical expressions, starting with polynomials;
the sources of inspiration for this project were Wolfram Alpha, MATLAB and manim.
